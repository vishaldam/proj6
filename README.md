===================

**This project is built on the [Stamplay](https://stamplay.com) platform with [Ionic Framework](http://ionicframework.com/) to show you how to build a post-and-search application, like [eBay Classifieds](https://itunes.apple.com/en/app/ebay-classifieds/id363971383?mt=8).**

*eBay is 20! During the last two decades hundreds of millions of people around the world have used the service to buy and sell items. Now its Classifieds mobile app is bringing free local listings to your pocket.*

In this project we'll show you how to use Stamplay with the amazing Ionic Framework to create a fully fledged native mobile app. We wanted to deliver something that can be reused in many ways so we decided to build an eBay Classifieds clone to let users search, post, and sell their items.

The app will have the following functionality:

* guest users can search, filter (Category and City) and view posted items
* guest users can post items to sell
* guest users need to confirm a valid email address before posting an item
* guest and logged in users can contact the owners of an item
* logged in users can track their listings
* guest and logged in users can contact the app administrator
* guest users need to signup with email and password to access all features
